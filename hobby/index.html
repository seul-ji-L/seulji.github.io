  <p> <span class="subheadline">What is Yoga?</span>  More than a practice, yoga is a lifestyle that heals, cares for and strengthens the body, mind, and spirit through the practice of asanas, breathing, and meditation.
        Practiced in India for thousands of years, it has become one of the systems of physical and spiritual conditioning with more followers in our days.
Hinduism is one of the most complex cultures in the world. Yoga is part of their religious, spiritual, cultural and social tradition. 
        There are texts from thousands of years ago that already speak about meditation practices, breathing, transcendence of the self and a series of postures that help the yogi to purify his body: the asanas.
        There are more than one hundred types of yoga.
        In the West, various styles that derive from Hatha Yoga, one of the most dynamic, are known and practiced. There are more spiritual ones, such as Kundalini Yoga, or more physical and demanding, such as Bikram Yoga, which is practiced in a warm room. There is even a facial yoga to relax and tone the muscles of the face.</p>
    Yoga is also associated with the beliefs and practices of several religions that originated in India. Outside of India, yoga is commonly known as the practice of asanas of hatha yoga or as a form of exercise. Yoga has recently become very popular in New York. Hindu scriptures such as the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and Siva Samhita describe various aspects of yoga.</p>
    The major categories of yoga include hatha yoga, karma yoga, jnana yoga, bhakti yoga, and raja yoga. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains karma yoga, jnana yoga, and bhakti yoga to Arjuna. The best Hindu scriptures on bhakti yoga are the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana. Comparing the two, the Bhagavad Gita deals with bhakti more theoretically, while the Bhagavata Purana deals with bhakti more practically. Raja yoga was established by Patanjali's Yoga Sutra. The school of yoga established by Patanjali uses the Yoga Sutra as its main scripture and Raja yoga as its practice.</p>

    <p>
        <span class="subheadline"> What Yoga Consists Of?</span> During a yoga session, this usually lasts between an hour and an hour and a half, different asanas or postures harmonized with breathing are practiced, beneficial for both the body and the mind.
        Asanas have different degrees of difficulty, from the simplest ones for beginners to the most extreme ones practiced by advanced students.
         Most classes usually start with a warm-up called "Greetings to the Sun", which includes a dynamic succession of positions that start standing and make us go down to the floor to warm and lubricate muscles and joints. All this combined with breathing, which helps us generate heat and body energy.
         After the warm-up begins with the asanas or static positions, always making a posture and its contra posture to work the body and the muscles in a balanced way.
         If the class is dynamic, as in the case of Yoga Flow, Power, Dynamic or Ashtanga, the asanas will be made in motion, in a fluid way.</p>
        All yoga classes end with a relaxation of about 10 or 15 minutes in which the body and mind are returned to calm. Depending on the style of yoga or the teacher, a final meditation can also be done.
       Yoga as a Hobby can be practiced in a specialized center or sports club or, once you have learned the correct technique and asanas, follow a personal practice, which allows us to exercise and calm our mind wherever we are.

    <p>
        <span class="subheadline">Health Benefits Yoga</span> The practice of yoga in any of its modalities produces a great change, not only physical, in those who practice it, because it provides control, balance and inner peacAsanas lubricate the organs, improve blood circulation and muscle flexibility, and help the joints, muscles and other parts of the body function properly.
The asanas not only exercise the muscles, strength, endurance, and balance but massage the internal organs, activate the metabolism (practicing yoga usually burn many calories, especially at rest), oxygenate the body and improve intestinal functioning.
This is the case of the inverted postures, which renew the blood flow, rejuvenating the organism from within.
Doing yoga regularly provides energy and improves health, strengthens and stretches the muscles of the entire body, correcting postural problems and preventing back and joint pathologies.</p>
Practicing yoga will not only change our body but our energy, it will help us to be more aware of ourselves, to discover many things that have to do with our soul, to take care of our body in a healthy way, to acquire calmness and serenity.
Yoga is especially recommended for those who seek a system of physical conditioning that not only trains your body but also allows you to work your mind.
Thus, it is perfect for those who suffer stress, anxiety and have sleep or depression problems; and for those who want to develop their spiritual part and change their lifestyle.
