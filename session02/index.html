      Body Fortress 100% Whey, Premium Protein Powder, Vanilla, 1.74lbs

      <p>You'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal in terms of cost per gram of protein. This delivers 30 grams of protein per serving (more than many other protein powders) and provides excellent value at roughly $1/serving. Tastes great and is easy to dissolve. Sure, it is possible to enough protein from regular food sources but even at 1.5 g of protein per kg of body weight, requires a LOT of planning and effort. This is a good supplement to an existing healthy diet. For a long time I didn't pay much attention to the importance of additional protein for weight training, but it is just as important as the workouts themselves. Repeat customer, very satisfied with this product.</p>

      <p>I compared this to my regular<i>Gold Standard Whey protein</i> as it tastes very similar. I just ordered a 2nd one to see how well this works. Only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because its a little too sweet and it doesnt disolve in hot oatmeal. It blends well with yogurt and almond milk in a blender. I will be having 60g protein a day and get back to y’all in 2 months for an update on gains lol</p>

      <p><i>Granted</i> I’ve lost 60 lbs in fat in the past two years, however, I’ve hit my plateau… I’ve gained a lot of muscle in the past year and half thanks to my job and working out, which is amazing, however I’m still needing to drop 30 more lbs of stubborn fat, mid section and thighs. That seems to really want to stay lol I’m 40 yrs young , female and things just don’t fall off the way they did in my 20’s lol I also have a c-section belly which sucks - woman that have this will understand!</p>

      <p>I also get an upset stomach, so I also have to take in <i>2 monsters or 2 ghost energy drinks</i> throughout my work days to have the energy to keep up. My job is very physical, I lift, carry, push and pull <i>6-10k lbs per day, 5 days a week </i>.. and I walk on average <i>15-20 miles per day.</i> I do workout at home on my days off as well. Unless I’m just that beat up from work, then I rest. Anyways, The other brand is great for energy and the taste isn’t terrible, especially being a coffee flavor, However it has 30g of protein per scoop, I usually take 2 scoops in the morning and 2 mid day. As I have to take in 150g of protein each day to burn the fat that’s hanging out and build what I’m shooting for in my goals.</p>

      <p>Just how it took time to pack on the lbs , didn’t happen overnight, Find your body, find what works for you and eat what works for you, not what someone tells you what to eat because it worked for them. Same goes for working out, what works for someone else, may not work for you. Try things, for a few weeks and adjust where you feel the need to adjust. <i>Work with a good PT</i> if you need that help to get started, find a trainer that will listen to you and apply the tools you need to get where you want to be and eventually be able to do them on your own. If you come across a trainer that really isn’t listening to your needs or isn’t giving you a good feeling , find another trainer, bc those ones just want your money, they don’t truly care about your needs or wants.Yes they do exist. Good luck in your journey! You can do this ! Everyone can.</p>
